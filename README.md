# Goursat-Quartic-Surface

### **Goursat Quartic Surface Explanation**
The **Goursat Quartic Surface** is a mathematical surface defined by a quartic (fourth-degree) polynomial equation. It is a type of implicit surface that exhibits complex and symmetrical structures, making it useful in 3D visualization, mathematical modeling, and artistic renderings.

Your code implements a version of this surface using **point cloud rendering**, where the surface is represented by points that satisfy a modified Goursat quartic equation.

### **How This Works in Your Code**
- The equation is **evaluated for many points** in 3D space.
- If a point satisfies the equation **(i.e., its value is close to zero within a threshold like 0.2)**, it is added to the point cloud.
- The result is a **symmetrical, intricate shape** that visually resembles the structure in your reference image.
